Bees Algorithm

This tutorial is about a basic form of Bees Algorithm.
The Bees Algorithm is a population-based nature-inspired search algorithm, first developed in 2005 by Duc Truong Pham and his co-workers. 
The algorithm mimics the food foraging behaviour of swarms of honey bees. 
In its basic version, the algorithm performs a kind of neighbourhood search combined with random search and can be used for both combinatorial optimisation and functional optimisation.
